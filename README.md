## [Project: Simple Banking System](https://hyperskill.org/projects/109)

In this project, you will find out how the banking system works and learn about SQL. We'll also see how Luhn algorithm can help us avoid mistakes when entering the card number. As an overall result, you'll get new experience in Python.

## [Project: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://hyperskill.org/projects/73)

After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using functions, handling errors, and processing user input.

## [Project: Hangman](https://hyperskill.org/projects/69)

Best project for Python Basics: uses functions, loops, lists, and other variables. The Random module is a cherry on top. Don’t be intimidated by the number of stages – they ensure that your immersion in Python is smooth and safe.
