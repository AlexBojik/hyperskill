## [Project: Simple Banking System](https://hyperskill.org/projects/109)

In this project, you will find out how the banking system works and learn about SQL. We'll also see how Luhn algorithm can help us avoid mistakes when entering the card number. As an overall result, you'll get new experience in Python.

## [Project: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://hyperskill.org/projects/73)

After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using functions, handling errors, and processing user input.

## [Project: Hangman](https://hyperskill.org/projects/69)

Best project for Python Basics: uses functions, loops, lists, and other variables. The Random module is a cherry on top. Don’t be intimidated by the number of stages – they ensure that your immersion in Python is smooth and safe.

## [Project: Coffee Machine](https://hyperskill.org/projects/68)

This project allows you to get a taste of Python. Practice working with functions, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident in Python.

## [Project: Numeric Matrix Processor](https://hyperskill.org/projects/96)

Apart from learning a whole lot about matrices, you will become familiar with the Math library, recursion, and the many ways of using nested lists in practice.

## [Project: Smart Calculator](https://hyperskill.org/projects/74)

Apart from writing a useful program (everyone uses calculators!), you will learn a lot about lists, strings and dictionaries. You will also get closer experience with 2 important data structures: the stack and the queue.

## [Project: To-Do List](https://hyperskill.org/projects/105)

To-Do list that will help you manage your tasks. You will practice using loops, conditions and statement branches. And also you will learn the basics of SQLAlchemy to manage SQLite database on python!
